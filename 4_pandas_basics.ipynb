I suspect this is due to [bankers rounding](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10825926/python-3-x-rounding-behavior), which would be fine, but it also looks like pandas doesn't mimic the native python rounding behaviour, which rounds both to -0.03 - this might trip people up.   \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nRound -0.025 to -0.03, or if this explicitly avoided as part of your rounding strategy, at least make your strategy match the python round function.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\npython                : 3.10.15.final.0\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 10\\nVersion               : 10.0.22631\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 186 Stepping 3, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en\\nLOCALE                : English_United Kingdom.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\nsetuptools            : 75.1.0\\npip                   : 22.3.1\\nCython                : None\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\nhypothesis            : None\\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\\nblosc                 : None\\nfeather               : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\nIPython               : 8.27.0\\npandas_datareader     : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.2\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.1\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.14.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

However, in my case `s1 - s2`, `s1` contains an all `nan` index row which raises a `ValueError: Length of values (5) does not match length of index (4)`.\\n\\nI found that this could be an error in how the two series are aligned.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Series(...):\\n    ...\\n    def _align_series(...):\\n        ...\\n        if not axis:\\n            # equal\\n            if self.index.equals(other.index):\\n                join_index, lidx, ridx = None, None, None\\n            else:\\n                join_index, lidx, ridx = self.index.join(\\n                    other.index, how=join, level=level, return_indexers=True\\n                )\\n\\n                ## At this point, `join_index` is invalid as it contains different length codes:\\n                ## join_index.code ==  FrozenList([[0, 0, 1, 1], [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], [-1, 0, 1, 1, 2]])\\n                ## which returns (4 items in level index 0)\\n                ##   join_index.get_level_values(0) ==           Index([81.0, 81.0, 82.0, 82.0], dtype=\\'float64\\', name=\\'foo\\')\\n                ## while (5 items in level index 1 and 2)\\n                ##   join_index.get_level_values(1) ==           Index([nan,   nan,  nan,  nan, nan], dtype=\\'float64\\', name=\\'demand_index\\')\\n                ##   join_index.get_level_values(2) == DatetimeIndex([\\'NaT\\', \\'2018-06-01\\', \\'2018-07-01\\', \\'2018-07-01\\', \\'2018-08-01\\'], dtype=\\'datetime64[ns]\\', name=\\'blend_date\\', freq=None)\\n                ##\\n\\n            if is_series:\\n                ## The invalid `join_index` is picked up by `._reindex_indexer(...)` as `len(join_index)` == 4 and `len(new_values) == 5` which causes the `ValueError`\\n                left = self._reindex_indexer(join_index, lidx, copy)\\n        ...\\n\\n\\n\\n    def _reindex_indexer(...):\\n        ...\\n        new_values = algorithms.take_nd(\\n            self._values, indexer, allow_fill=True, fill_value=None\\n        )\\n        return self._constructor(new_values, index=new_index, copy=False)  ## <- raises the ValueError\\n```\\n\\nI traced the origin of the mismatching codes to `pandas.core.indexes.base.py:Index._join_level` which blatantly ignores missing values to construct a new index.\\n\\n```python\\nclass Index(...):\\n     def _join_level(...):\\n        ...\\n        else:\\n            left_lev_indexer = ensure_platform_int(left_lev_indexer)\\n            rev_indexer = lib.get_reverse_indexer(left_lev_indexer, len(old_level))\\n            old_codes = left.codes[level]\\n\\n            ## This will ignore missing values (nan) without ever inserting\\n            ## those values back into the index, ultimately leading to\\n            ## different length codes\\n            taker = old_codes[old_codes != -1]\\n            new_lev_codes = rev_indexer.take(taker)\\n\\n            new_codes = list(left.codes)\\n            new_codes[level] = new_lev_codes\\n\\n            new_levels = list(left.levels)\\n            new_levels[level] = new_level\\n\\n            if keep_order:  # just drop missing values. o.w. keep order\\n                left_indexer = np.arange(len(left), dtype=np.intp)\\n                left_indexer = cast(np.ndarray, left_indexer)\\n                mask = new_lev_codes != -1\\n                if not mask.all():\\n                    new_codes = [lab[mask] for lab in new_codes]\\n                    left_indexer = left_indexer[mask]\\n            ...\\n            join_index = MultiIndex(\\n                levels=new_levels,\\n                codes=new_codes,\\n                names=left.names,\\n                verify_integrity=False,\\n            )\\n```\\n\\n\\nThis is all possible because `verify_integrity` is set to False (and not passed down). If I set `verify_integrity=True` the `join_index = MultiIndex(...)` fails much earlier with `ValueError: Length of levels and codes must match. NOTE: this index is in an inconsistent state.`\\n\\n\\n```python\\nclass MultiIndex(...):\\n    def __new__(...):\\n        ...\\n        # result._set_codes(codes, copy=copy, validate=False)\\n        result._set_codes(codes, copy=copy, validate=False, verify_integrity=True)\\n        ...\\n```\\n\\nI tried to fix this by changing the `taker = old_codes[old_codes != -1]` to `taker = old_codes`. This alleviates the initial `ValueError` (just tested for my case). If I also comment out the -1 handling, I get the desired expected behaviour.\\n\\n```\\n   # if not mask.all():\\n   #     new_codes = [lab[mask] for lab in new_codes]\\n   #     left_indexer = left_indexer[mask]\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\n```\\n>>> s1 - s2\\nfoo  bar  date      \\nNaN  NaN  NaT                NaN\\n81   NaN  2018-06-01   -3.221031\\n          2018-07-01   -5.760249\\n82   NaN  2018-07-01   -4.402019\\n          2018-08-01   -3.624764\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\n```\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit              : e86ed377639948c64c429059127bcf5b359ab6be\\npython              : 3.11.11.final.0\\npython-bits         : 64\\nOS                  : Linux\\nOS-release          : 6.12.11-200.fc41.x86_64\\nVersion             : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jan 24 04:59:58 UTC 2025\\nmachine             : x86_64\\nprocessor           : \\nbyteorder           : little\\nLC_ALL              : None\\nLANG                : en_AU.UTF-8\\nLOCALE              : en_AU.UTF-8\\n\\npandas              : 2.1.1\\nnumpy               : 1.24.3\\npytz                : 2020.4\\ndateutil            : 2.8.2\\nsetuptools          : 69.2.0\\npip                 : 24.2\\nCython              : 0.29.34\\npytest              : 7.3.1\\nhypothesis          : None\\nsphinx              : None\\nblosc               : None\\nfeather             : None\\nxlsxwriter          : 0.9.6\\nlxml.etree          : None\\nhtml5lib            : None\\npymysql             : None\\npsycopg2            : 2.9.6\\njinja2              : 2.11.2\\nIPython             : None\\npandas_datareader   : None\\nbs4                 : None\\nbottleneck          : 1.3.5\\ndataframe-api-compat: None\\nfastparquet         : None\\nfsspec              : None\\ngcsfs               : None\\nmatplotlib          : None\\nnumba               : None\\nnumexpr             : 2.8.4\\nodfpy               : None\\nopenpyxl            : 3.1.2\\npandas_gbq          : None\\npyarrow             : 11.0.0\\npyreadstat          : None\\npyxlsb              : None\\ns3fs                : None\\nscipy               : 1.10.1\\nsqlalchemy          : 1.3.23\\ntables              : 3.8.0\\ntabulate            : None\\nxarray              : None\\nxlrd                : 2.0.1\\nzstandard           : None\\ntzdata              : 2024.2\\nqtpy                : None\\npyqt5               : None\\n```\\nAlso happens with pandas==2.2.3\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

Performing the `namedtuple`-to-`dict` conversion process isn\\'t difficult normally, but in some situation (e.g. doing so in a list/set/dict comprehension), it\\'s more convenient to have a generator that does the process automatically for you.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nAdd a new function to DataFrames, `iterdicts`, that takes an `index` argument (equivalent to the same argument in `itertuples`) and returns each row as a dictionary the same way itertuples does so as a namedtuple. (No need to take a \"name\" argument, since that\\'s irrelevant for dictionaries.)\\n```python\\ndef iterdicts(self, index=True):\\n    for x in self.itertuples(index):\\n        yield x._asdict()\\n```\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nWrite a custom function that does the same thing externally.\\n```python\\ndef iterdicts(df, index=True):\\n    for x in df.itertuples(index):\\n        yield x._asdict()\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_',\n",

Would be nice if anyone could find a fix to this.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThat the memory doesnt leak\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.13.1\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 11\\nVersion               : 10.0.22631\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 186 Stepping 2, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en\\nLOCALE                : Norwegian Bokmål_Norway.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2024.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 24.2\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : 8.1.3\\nIPython               : 8.31.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.5\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.0\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2024.2\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.2\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

This results in a loss of structure and requires additional parsing during data retrieval.\\n\\nMany machine learning practitioners store intermediate results, including embeddings and model-generated representations, in Pandas DataFrames. However, when saving such data using CSV, the complex data types are converted to string format, making them difficult to work with when reloading the DataFrame.\\n\\nCurrent Workarounds:\\n\\nPickle: While Pickle retains structure, it is not cross-platform friendly and has security concerns when loading untrusted files.\\nParquet: Parquet supports complex structures better but may not be the default choice for many users who rely on CSV.\\nManual Parsing: Users often need to reprocess stringified NumPy arrays back into their original format, which is inefficient and error-prone.\\nFeature Request:\\nIntroduce an option in Pandas to serialize and deserialize complex data types when saving to and loading from CSV, possibly by:\\n\\nAllowing automatic conversion of NumPy arrays to lists during CSV storage.\\nProviding a built-in method for reconstructing complex data types when reading CSV files.\\nSupporting a more intuitive way to store and load multi-dimensional data efficiently without requiring workarounds.\\n\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\n1. Modify to_csv() to Handle Complex Data Types\\nIntroduce a new parameter (e.g., preserve_complex=True) in to_csv() that automatically converts NumPy arrays to lists before saving.\\n\\nPseudocode:\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nclass EnhancedDataFrame(pd.DataFrame):\\n    def to_csv(self, filename, preserve_complex=False, **kwargs):\\n        if preserve_complex:\\n            df_copy = self.copy()\\n            for col in df_copy.columns:\\n                if isinstance(df_copy[col].iloc[0], (np.ndarray, list)):  # Check for complex types\\n                    df_copy[col] = df_copy[col].apply(lambda x: json.dumps(x.tolist()))  # Convert arrays to JSON\\n        super().to_csv(filename, **kwargs)\\nIf preserve_complex=True, NumPy arrays and lists are serialized into JSON format before saving.\\nThe standard to_csv() functionality remains unchanged for other users.\\n\\n2. Modify read_csv() to Restore Complex Data Types\\nIntroduce a restore_complex=True parameter in read_csv() that automatically detects JSON-encoded lists and converts them back to NumPy arrays.\\n\\nPseudocode:\\nclass EnhancedDataFrame(pd.DataFrame):\\n    @staticmethod\\n    def from_csv(filename, restore_complex=False, **kwargs):\\n        df = pd.read_csv(filename, **kwargs)\\n        if restore_complex:\\n            for col in df.columns:\\n                if df[col].apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, str) and x.startswith(\"[\")).all():  # Check for JSON format\\n                    df[col] = df[col].apply(lambda x: np.array(json.loads(x)))  # Convert back to NumPy array\\n        return df\\nIf restore_complex=True, JSON-encoded lists are automatically converted back to NumPy arrays when reading a CSV file.\\nExample Usage\\npython\\nCopy\\nEdit\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\'id\\': [1, 2], \\'embedding\\': [np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3]), np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6])]})\\n\\n# Save with complex type handling\\ndf.to_csv(\"data.csv\", preserve_complex=True)\\n\\n# Load and restore complex types\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\", restore_complex=True)\\nprint(df_loaded[\"embedding\"][0])  # Output: array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3])\\n\\nExpected Benefits\\n✅ Users will be able to save and retrieve NumPy arrays, embeddings, or complex objects easily using CSV.\\n✅ Reduces the need for workarounds like Pickle or manual parsing.\\n✅ Keeps Pandas CSV handling more intuitive for machine learning workflows.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nEnhance documentation to recommend best practices for handling complex data types with Pandas and suggest an official approach for this use case.\\n\\nAdditional Context:\\n\\nA common issue in ML workflows that involve embeddings, image vectors, and multi-dimensional numerical data.\\nOther libraries like PyArrow and Dask handle complex data better, but many users prefer Pandas for ease of use.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n1. Using JSON Format Instead of CSV\\nInstead of saving complex data to a CSV file, users can save the DataFrame as a JSON file, which supports nested data structures.\\n\\nExample\\ndf.to_json(\"data.json\", orient=\"records\")\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_json(\"data.json\")\\n✅ Pros:\\nNatively supports lists and dictionaries without conversion.\\nReadable and widely supported format.\\n❌ Cons:\\n\\nJSON files are not as efficient as CSV for large datasets.\\nJSON format is not always easy to work with in spreadsheet software.\\n2. Using Pickle for Serialization\\nPandas provides built-in support for Pickle, which can store and retrieve complex objects.\\n\\nExample\\ndf.to_pickle(\"data.pkl\")\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_pickle(\"data.pkl\")\\n✅ Pros:\\n\\nPreserves complex data types natively.\\nFast read/write operations.\\n❌ Cons:\\nPickle files are not human-readable.\\nThey are Python-specific, making them less portable for cross-platform use.\\n3. Using Parquet for Efficient Storage\\nParquet is a columnar storage format optimized for performance and supports complex data types.\\n\\nExample\\n\\ndf.to_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_parquet(\"data.parquet\")\\n✅ Pros:\\nEfficient storage with better compression.\\nSupports multi-dimensional data and preserves data types.\\n❌ Cons:\\nRequires pyarrow or fastparquet dependencies.\\nNot as universally used as CSV.\\n4. Manual Preprocessing for CSV Storage\\nUsers often manually convert complex data to JSON strings before saving them to CSV.\\n\\nExample\\nimport json\\ndf[\"embedding\"] = df[\"embedding\"].apply(lambda x: json.dumps(x.tolist()))\\ndf.to_csv(\"data.csv\", index=False)\\n\\ndf_loaded = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\\ndf_loaded[\"embedding\"] = df_loaded[\"embedding\"].apply(lambda x: np.array(json.loads(x)))\\n✅ Pros:\\nWorks with existing Pandas functionality.\\nCSV remains human-readable.\\n❌ Cons:\\nRequires manual preprocessing each time.\\nError-prone and inefficient for large datasets.\\n\\nWhy the Proposed Feature is Needed\\nWhile these alternatives exist, they require either additional dependencies, manual preprocessing, or compromise on format usability. Adding native support for preserving and restoring complex data types in Pandas CSV operations would:\\n\\nEliminate the need for external libraries like JSON, Pickle, or Parquet.\\nImprove usability for machine learning and data science workflows.\\nKeep CSV files human-readable while ensuring data integrity.',\n",

In the example below the third call should not return a valid date, as no week 53 exists in the isoclander year 2024 (the first lines are non-isoclandar, the last line is the first week in isocalendar 2025, which are all correct).\\n\\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a50f2d0-3b41-42ce-96f4-edcc50bda818)\\n\\nThis behavior can be seen in others years with 52 isoweeks as well, e.g. pd.to_datetime(\"2023-53-1\", format=\"%G-%V-%u\") also returns the date of the first isoweek of 2024.\\n\\nThe python standard library correctly raises an error when the same thing is tried:\\n\\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f26a9c3e-370d-420c-9db8-96d75cf5d573)\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nRaise an error for misformatted date string.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.12.6\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 11\\nVersion               : 10.0.26100\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : AMD64 Family 23 Model 113 Stepping 0, AuthenticAMD\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en\\nLOCALE                : English_Germany.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.1.2\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0\\npip                   : 24.2\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : 8.0.2\\nIPython               : 8.28.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.2\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 18.1.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.14.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\ntzdata                : 2024.2\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

My main requirements for such an index unset are:\\n- the output should have the most trivial index possible, i.e. an unnamed range index\\n- if the input has only an unnamed range index, the \"unset\" operation should be a no-op\\n- if the input has a named index, it should be kept as a new column (or columns for a multi-index)\\n- if the input is not a simple RangeIndex and is unnamed, raise a value error to remind me to decide whether that index is supposed to be meaningful (typically I\\'d name it if so, or do `.reset_index(drop=True)` if not).\\n\\nUsage of the `.reset_index` method to cover all of these requirements in a general sense requires a bit of nuance:\\n- calling `df.reset_index()` introduces a new column named simply \"index\" when users forget to use `keep=False` even when the index is [trivial] unnamed range index. In a stricter/safer world, you might want an error instead when you\\'re about to construct a data frame column from an unnamed index.\\n- the requirement to specify `keep` at all is sometime onerous; it typically would be preferable to have a method that\\'s a no-op in case the existing index is already an unnamed range index.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nDefine a new `unset_index` method on DataFrame something like \\n\\n```\\ndef unset_index(self) -> Self:\\n    if is_unnamed_range_index(df.index):\\n        return df\\n    if index_has_any_unnamed_col(df.index):\\n        raise ValueError(\\n            \"At least one column of the index is unnamed while the index itself is not a RangeIndex. \"\\n            \"Set the names of the index columns before calling unset, or just call reset_index(drop=True) directly.\"\\n        )\\n    return df.reset_index(drop=False, allow_duplicates=False)\\n```\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nUntil something like this is available in pandas, I\\'m using the [unset](https://github.com/zkurtz/pandahandler/blob/7d4320512c8015a5f70e903a9fcc0e62ce339aff/pandahandler/indexes.py#L47-L77) method in pandahandler.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_',\n",

       "  'body': '**Summary of Changes:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Enhanced the error messaging in the .query() method for pandas DataFrames when duplicate column names are present.\\r\\n- Prior to this change, invoking .query() on a DataFrame with duplicate column names resulted in an unclear TypeError, making it difficult for users to understand the root cause.\\r\\n- With this update, users will now receive a more descriptive and helpful ValueError, similar to when columns are accessed directly, with a message such as:\\r\\n  `\"ValueError: cannot reindex on an axis with duplicate labels\"`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Reasoning Behind the Change:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- The current behavior of .query() did not offer clear feedback when users attempted to run queries on DataFrames with duplicate column names.\\r\\n- By improving the error message, we enhance the overall user experience, making it easier for users to diagnose and resolve issues related to duplicate columns.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Testing Approach:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- I tested the change by creating a sample DataFrame with duplicate column names and attempted to execute a .query() operation.\\r\\n- Below is the test case used:\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\n# Create a DataFrame with duplicate column names\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\\r\\n    \"A\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\\r\\n    \"B\": [10, 8, 6, 4, 2],\\r\\n    \"A\": [5, 4, 3, 2, 1],  # Duplicate column name \"A\"\\r\\n})\\r\\n\\r\\n# Test the query functionality\\r\\ntry:\\r\\n    result = df.query(\"A <= 4 and B <= 8\")\\r\\n    print(result)\\r\\nexcept Exception as e:\\r\\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n- After applying the fix, the code will raise a ValueError, indicating that queries cannot be executed due to duplicate column names, making it much easier to pinpoint the issue.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Issue Addressed:**\\r\\n- This PR resolves the issue documented in [#60863](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/60863), where .query() failed to provide a clear error message when used on DataFrames containing duplicate column names.',\n",

This is surprising in particular because `StringDtype(\"pyarrow\")` does not exhibit the same problem.\\n\\nNote that in the bug reproduction example, `DataFrame.convert_dtypes` with `dtype_backend=\"pyarrow\"` converts `string` columns to `ArrowDtype(pyarrow.string())` rather than `StringDtype(\"pyarrow\")`.\\n\\nFinally, here\\'s a sample run, with dtypes printed out for clarity; I\\'ve reproduced this on both OS X and OpenSuse Tumbleweed for the listed pandas and pyarrow versions (as well as current `main`):\\n```python\\nIn [7]: import pandas as pd\\n\\nIn [8]: df = pd.DataFrame({\"key\": range(100000), \"val\": \"test\"})\\n\\nIn [9]: df[\"val\"].dtype\\nOut[9]: dtype(\\'O\\')\\n\\nIn [10]: %timeit df.groupby([\"key\"]).first();\\n8.37 ms ± 599 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\\n\\nIn [11]: pa_df = df.convert_dtypes(dtype_backend=\"pyarrow\")\\n\\nIn [13]: type(pa_df[\"val\"].dtype)\\nOut[13]: pandas.core.dtypes.dtypes.ArrowDtype\\n\\nIn [14]: %timeit pa_df.groupby([\"key\"]).first();\\n2.39 s ± 142 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\\n\\nIn [15]: pa_df = pa_df.astype({\"val\": pd.StringDtype(\"pyarrow\")})\\n    ...:\\n\\nIn [16]: type(pa_df[\"val\"].dtype)\\nOut[16]: pandas.core.arrays.string_.StringDtype\\n\\nIn [17]: %timeit pa_df.groupby([\"key\"]).first();\\n12.9 ms ± 306 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nAggregation performance on `ArrowDtype(pyarrow.string())` columns should be comparable to aggregation performance on `StringDtype(\"pyarrow\")`, `string` typed columns.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.13.1\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Darwin\\nOS-release            : 24.3.0\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:16 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\nmachine               : arm64\\nprocessor             : arm\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : en_CA.UTF-8\\nLANG                  : None\\nLOCALE                : en_CA.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 24.3.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.32.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.5\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n# Some index that are not integers\\nindex = pd.date_range(start='2000-01-01', periods=3, freq='YS')\\n\\n# Integer as a name\\ndata = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=index, name=2)\\n\\ndata.groupby(data) # FutureWarning: Series.__getitem__ treating keys as positions is deprecated. In a future version, integer keys will always be treated as labels (consistent with DataFrame behavior). To access a value by position, use `ser.iloc[pos]`\\n```\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nThe warning comes from this line:\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7/pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py#L1015\\n\\nHere, `gpr.name` is `2`, which results in the warning. If the index consists of integers, this means `obj[gpr.name]` will actually return the line (which then fails the comparison).\\n\\n\\nI have not checked on the main branch, but the same line might be present here:\\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/d72f165eb327898b1597efe75ff8b54032c3ae7b/pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py#L853\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nDon't issue `FutureWarning`\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.13.0\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 11\\nVersion               : 10.0.22621\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 186 Stepping 3, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : English_United Kingdom.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.0\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.32.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : None\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.0\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

This behavior impacts a situation where an existing .h5 file is being updated with more data. This is a **low-priority bug**, since the issue is avoidable in this situation by using the \\'w\\' open mode instead. \\n\\nExample output:\\n```\\n\\'w\\' mode\\'\\n\\'w.h5\\' size: 3974104\\n\\'w.h5\\' size: 3974104\\n\\'w.h5\\' size: 3974104\\n\\'w.h5\\' size: 3974104\\n\\'w.h5\\' size: 3974104\\n\\'a\\' mode\\'\\n\\'a.h5\\' size: 3974104\\n\\'a.h5\\' size: 4776152\\n\\'a.h5\\' size: 5578200\\n\\'a.h5\\' size: 6380248\\n\\'a.h5\\' size: 7182296\\n\\'a\\' mode, only numerical\\'\\n\\'a_numerical.h5\\' size: 815240\\n\\'a_numerical.h5\\' size: 815312\\n\\'a_numerical.h5\\' size: 815312\\n\\'a_numerical.h5\\' size: 815312\\n\\'a_numerical.h5\\' size: 815312\\n\\'a\\' mode, only strings\\'\\n\\'a_strings.h5\\' size: 1070008\\n\\'a_strings.h5\\' size: 1076152\\n\\'a_strings.h5\\' size: 1080248\\n\\'a_strings.h5\\' size: 1084344\\n\\'a_strings.h5\\' size: 1088440\\n```\\n\\nAs we can see, as identically-sized data is being written into a.h5 and a_strings.h5, the size of the file increases.\\n\\nApologies in advance for not providing a fix, but since the workaround is very easy I didn\\'t want to spend much time digging into it. Also sorry if it\\'s written in documentation somewhere to avoid using the \\'a\\' option. \\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nOpening an HDFStore in \\'a\\' mode and overwriting keys with dataframes containing string values does not lead to unnecessarily increasing file size.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.12.3\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.8.0-52-generic\\nVersion               : #53-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Jan 11 00:06:25 UTC 2025\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.2\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.0\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.5\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.2\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : 3.10.2\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",
